# Project Vision

## 1. Purpose
Define and implement a modular 2/3-axis FPV gimbal system for drones,
providing high-precision camera stabilization and real-time orientation feedback
to a flight controller.

## 2. Background
Modern FPV drones often use fixed cameras or simple stabilization mounts.
This project aims to create an open, extensible gimbal platform capable of:
- accurate attitude tracking,
- closed-loop control with BLDC motors,
- feedback data exchange with flight controllers.

## 3. System Goals
-  Provide stable camera orientation on 2 or 3 axes.
-  Measure angular position and velocity with high accuracy.
-  Communicate orientation data to a higher-level controller (e.g., FC).
-  Maintain low latency.
-  Support modular motor drivers and IMU sensors.
